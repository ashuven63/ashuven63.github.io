subtitle: Machine Learning Lead @ Google

<br>I am a part of Google Local Search team leading efforts in building next era of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVsiusLQy5Q">Generative Search</a> using LLMs particularly <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>. 
My interests lie in Applied machine learning and with rise of LLMs, how can use these models to automate tasks, improve effieciency and build powerful products delivering user value.<br><br>

Previously, I built voice assistant for Smart home operating system at <a href="https://www.caspar.ai/">Caspar.ai</a> and was the 10th engineer to join the startup.<br><br>

Besdies this I am also very passionate about climate tech and believe there are many interesting engineering problems which we can solve using AI. Currently I contribute to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/how-ai-is-improving-agriculture-sustainability-in-india/">Anthrokrishi</a> which is trying to enable sustainable argiculture in India.
I want to continue thinking about problems in this space and happy to chat with folks interested in this space.<br><br>
