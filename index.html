My interests lie in Applied machine learning and with rise of LLMs, how can use these models to automate tasks, improve effiecient and deliver user value.<br><br>

Previously, I built voice assistant for Smart home operating system at <a href="https://www.caspar.ai/">Caspar.ai</a> and was the 10th engineer to join the startup.<br><br>
